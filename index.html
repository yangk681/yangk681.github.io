		<h4>Kristi Yang</h4>

		<h3>All about me.</h3>

		<p>Hi there, it's Kristi!</p>

		<p>I'm freshman at Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts at The New School in New York City, pursuing a B.A. in Journalism + Design (and yes, that's ONE major).</p>

		<p>I'm from the suburbs of New Jersey, but was born in New York City and have lived in NY, NJ, Beijing, and—most recently—Singapore.</p>

		<p>I enjoy traveling, working out, listening to podcasts, hanging out with friends, finding and trying new restaurants, and playing dress up in my closet.</p>

		<p>In the future, I hope to work for a women's fashion magazine or for a digital media company.</p>
